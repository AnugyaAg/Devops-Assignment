# DevOps Assignment: Version Control Systems
## Subversion (SVN)
Subversion (SVN) is an open-source version control system that allows users to track changes, revert to previous versions, and merge new features efficiently.
### Types of Version Control Systems:
  - **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):** A single central server stores all versions.

  - **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):** Each user has a full copy of the repository.
### Why Use Version Control?
 - Track all changes and maintain history.
 - Rollback to previous versions when necessary.
 - Merge new features seamlessly.
 ### Installing & Setting Up SVN on Windows:
1. Download and install SVN (TortoiseSVN).
2. Restart your system after installation.
3. Verify the installation using:
   ```sh
   svn --version
   ```
